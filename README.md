# Dotfiles
This is a collection of all my dotfile configurations I use in [Fedora i3 Spin](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/i3). 
This *should* work for other distros running i3, but I can't guarantee functionality, of course. Feel free to copy
whatever you need!

> This is a work in progress and is nowhere near complete! I don't recommend copying anything here yet!
